# 🏥 Queue Cure – Real-Time Patient Flow & Digital Queue Platform

> **Queue Cure** is a full-stack healthcare platform designed to digitize patient flow, reduce waiting times, and improve the hospital experience through real-time queue management, appointment scheduling, live notifications, and analytics.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional hospital queues often involve long waiting times, manual token systems, and poor communication between patients, receptionists, and doctors. Queue Cure modernizes this process by providing a **real-time digital patient flow platform** with separate dashboards for receptionists, doctors, and patients.

Patients can book appointments, receive digital tokens, track their queue in real time, access their queue page using QR codes, and receive WhatsApp/SMS notifications. Receptionists can efficiently manage queues, while doctors can monitor consultations and patient flow.
